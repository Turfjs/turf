***A modular geospatial engine written in JavaScript***

[Turf](https://turfjs.org) is a [JavaScript library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_library) for [spatial analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_analysis). It includes traditional spatial operations, helper functions for creating [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org) data, and data classification and statistics tools. Turf can be added to your website as a client-side module, or you can [run Turf server-side](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turf/turf) with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (see below).


## Getting Started

Read our [getting started guide](https://turfjs.org/docs/getting-started) to begin working with Turf.

Or explore the Turf API and examples at [turfjs.org](https://turfjs.org/).

## Runtime support

Turf is currently published to work with any reasonably modern Javascript runtime.

Node is a first class citizen, and we recommend using an [Active or Maintenance LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases) release.

Other runtimes, such as Deno or Bun, are not officially supported. We would be very interested to hear your experiences though.

## Browser support

Turf uses Babel to transpile to a JavaScript version usable by most
modern browsers. Any browser that matches the following criteria as defined by [Browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist):

[> 0.25%, last 2 versions, fully supports es5, not dead](https://browsersl.ist/#q=%3E+0.25%25%2C+last+2+versions%2C+fully+supports+es5%2C+not+dead)
