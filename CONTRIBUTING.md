### :bug: [How to report a bug](http://polite.technology/reportabug.html)

## How To Contribute

- Most work happens in sub modules. These are modules prefixed with "turf-".
- If you would like to propose a new feature, open an issue in Turfjs/turf.
- Always include tests. We use [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape).
- Turf modules are small, containing a single exported function.
- GeoJSON is the lingua franca of Turf. It should be used as the data structure for anything that can be represented as geography.
- Avoid large dependencies at all costs.
- Turf is used in a wide range of places. Make sure that your code can run in the browser (ie: don't make calls to external services, don't hit the filesystem, etc.).
- The `README.md` files in `packages/turf-<module>` are automatically generated from the [JSDocs](http://usejsdoc.org/) of the `index.js`. Please modify the JSDocs instead of modifying the `README.md` files directly. Then update/create the `README.md` executing [`./scripts/generate-readmes`](https://github.com/Turfjs/turf/blob/master/scripts/generate-readmes) or runing `npm run docs` from the root TurfJS directory.
- Finally run `npm test` from the project root folder to run all the tests required for deploying the project.

## Code Style

To ensure code style, at the `turf` root level run

```sh
$ npm run lint
```

* Follow the [AirBNB JavaScript code style](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
* Turf aims to use ES5 features where rational. We do not use ES6 features.

## Structure of a turf module

```
turf-<MODULE NAME>
│   index.js
│   index.d.ts
│   bench.js
│   test.js
│   types.ts
│   package.json
│   README.md
│   LICENSE
│
└───test
    │
    ├───in
    │   points.geojson
    │
    └───out
        points.geojson
```
To get started with a new module navigate to the root directory and run
```sh
$ node ./scripts/create-new-module <MODULE NAME>
```
it will create a new folder inside `packages` with a simple boilerplate for your module.

* `index.js` - This file contains, in order, the various modules you need to
  import, the [JSDocs](http://usejsdoc.org) documentation, and, finally, the
  single exported function that the module provides. For more on the types
  supported in the documentation, see…
* `index.d.ts` - This is a [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) file
  that describes your function’s signature. For more on the types supported in
  TypeScript, see…
* `bench.js` - This file uses [Benchmark](https://benchmarkjs.com/) to time
  your function.
* `test.js` - This file includes your [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape)
  tests. We prefer dynamic testing built from GeoJSON files placed in
  `./test/in` that are subsequently written to `./test/out` if your `REGEN`
  [environment variable is set](https://askubuntu.com/a/58828) to `true`. If
  `REGEN` is set to a different value, then running `npm t` will compare the
  output of the tests to the files already present in `./test/out`.
* `types.ts` - A file that lists the custom TypeScript types used in
  `index.d.ts`.
* `package.json` - The [node](http://nodejs.org) metadata container file.
  Modules imported in `index.js` should be listed here under `dependencies`,
  and modules used in `test.js` and/or `bench.js` should be listed under
  `devDependencies`. `npm install` looks to this file to install dependencies
  in `./node_modules`.
* `README.md` - This README is generated _automatically_ by running `npm run
  docs` from the project root level. **DO NOT edit this file**.
* `LICENCE` - Like the README, this file should not be edited.
* `test/` - This directory holds the GeoJSON files that provide data for
  dynamic tests (in `./test/in`) and the results of the tests (in
  `./test/out`). The files in `./test/out` should **not** be edited by hand.
  They should be generated dynamically by [setting the environment
  variable](https://askubuntu.com/a/58828) `REGEN` to `true`, and then the
  tests should be checked against these files by setting `REGEN` to some other
  value. The resulting out-files can be drag-dropped into
  [geojson.io](http://geojson.io) to see, visually, if the module is behaving
  appropriately.


## Publishing

Install lerna:

```bash
$ npm install -g lerna@2.0.0-beta.34
```

Publish a test release:

```bash
$ lerna publish --canary
```

## Documentation

To update TurfJS's Documentation (README.md) use the following `npm run docs`:
  - **inside a module:** will only generate the docs of that module.
  - **main folder:** will generate docs for all modules.

### Documentation - Examples

**Only builds docs for `@turf/center`**

```bash
$ cd ./turf/packages/turf-center
$ npm run docs

> @turf/center@5.0.4 docs /Users/mac/Github/turf/packages/turf-center
> node ../../scripts/generate-readmes

Building Docs: @turf/center
```

**Builds docs for all modules**

```bash
$ cd ./turf
$ npm run docs
> @5.0.0 docs /Users/mac/Github/turf
> node ./scripts/generate-readmes

Building Docs: @turf/along
Building Docs: @turf/area
Building Docs: @turf/bbox-clip
Building Docs: @turf/bbox-polygon
Building Docs: @turf/bbox
Building Docs: @turf/bearing
Building Docs: @turf/bezier-spline
Building Docs: @turf/boolean-clockwise
....
