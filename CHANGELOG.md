# 3.6.4

Typescript definitions `index.d.ts` added to all the packages.

# 3.0.11

Fix turf-line-slice bug with vertical linestrings.

# 3.0.1

This is a big change in Turf! 3.0.0 is a release that targets the development
cycle of Turf, letting us work on it more and release more often.

**Monorepo**

Turf 3.x and forward is a **monorepo** project. We publish lots of little modules
as usual, but there's one repo - turfjs/turf - that contains all the code
and the issues for the Turf source code. We use [lerna](https://lernajs.io/)
to link these packages together and make sure they work.

Why? We already had internal turf modules, like `turf-meta`, and development
was harder and harder - we had a bunch of custom scripts to do releases and
tests, and these were just written for Turf. Lerna is from the very popular
and very well-maintained [babel](http://www.babeljs.io) project, and it
works really well, and reduces maintainer sadness.

**Simplicity**

Turf grew a bunch of modules that weren't totally necessary, or were
expressing only a line or two of JavaScript. We want to make things easier,
but these modules didn't make code more expressive and they hid complexity
where it didn't need to be hidden. Turf 3.x focuses on the core
functionalities we need, making sure they're tested and performant.

turf-erase has been renamed turf-difference to make its name more similar to the equivalents in other libraries.

Removed modules: merge, sum, min, max, average, median, variance, deviation, filter, remove, jenks, quantile.
See the upgrade guide below for replacements.

**Upgrading from v2**

**If you were using turf-merge**

turf-merge repeatedly called turf-union on an array of polygons. Here's
how to implement the same thing without the special module

```js
var clone = require('clone');
var union = require('turf-union');
function merge(polygons) {
  var merged = clone(polygons.features[0]), features = polygons.features;
  for (var i = 0, len = features.length; i < len; i++) {
    var poly = features[i];
    if (poly.geometry) merged = union(merged, poly);
  }
  return merged;
}
```
An alternative method that merges pairs of features recursively.
With large numbers and similar complexity of input geometries this can speed up run time by factor 10.
Choose depending on your use case.

```js
var union = require('turf-union');
function mergeBin(polygons) {
  var features = polygons.features;

  do {
    var merged = [], len = features.length;
    for (var i = 0; i < len-1; i += 2) {
      merged.push(turf.union(features[i], features[i+1]));
    }
    if (len % 2 !== 0) {
      merged.push(features[len-1]);
    }
    features = merged;
  } while(features.length > 1);

  return features[0];
}
```

**If you were using turf-sum, min, max, average, median, variance, deviation**

The `turf-collect` method provides the core of these statistical methods
and lets you bring your own statistical library, like `simple-statistics`,
`science.js`, or others.

For example, here's how to find the median of matched values with simple-statistics.
Finding other statistics, like variance, mean, and so on simply use other methods
from the statistics library.

```js
var ss = require('simple-statistics');
var turf = require('@turf/turf');

var poly1 = turf.polygon([[[0,0],[10,0],[10,10],[0,10],[0,0]]]);
var poly2 = turf.polygon([[[10,0],[20,10],[20,20],[20,0],[10,0]]]);
var polyFC = turf.featureCollection([poly1, poly2]);
var pt1 = turf.point([5,5], {population: 200});
var pt2 = turf.point([1,3], {population: 600});
var pt3 = turf.point([14,2], {population: 100});
var pt4 = turf.point([13,1], {population: 200});
var pt5 = turf.point([19,7], {population: 300});
var ptFC = turf.featureCollection([pt1, pt2, pt3, pt4, pt5]);

// collects values from matching points into an array called 'values'
var collected = turf.collect(polyFC, ptFC, 'population', 'values');

// finds the median of those values.
collected.features.forEach(function (feature) {
  feature.properties.median = ss.median(feature.properties.values);
});

console.log(JSON.stringify(collected, null, 2));
```

**If you were using turf-filter, turf-remove**

These modules were thin wrappers around native JavaScript methods: use
[Array.filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) instead:

```js
var filteredFeatures = features.filter(function(feature) {
  return feature.properties.value > 10;
});
```

**If you were using turf-jenks, turf-quantile**

Use Array.map to get values, and then bring your own statistical calculation,
like simple-statistics or science.js.

```js
var values = features.map(function(feature) {
  return feature.properties.value;
});
```

**If you were using turf-extent**

turf-extent's name was changed to turf-bbox. It is functionally the same.

```js
turf.bbox(poly) // [minx, miny, maxx, maxy]
```
