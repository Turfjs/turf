## About Turf.js

[TurfJS](http://turfjs.org/) is a modular geospatial analysis library designed for use in the browser as well as Node.js.
We provide almost 120 modules for people to use freely in their applications.
Our most [popular module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turf/helpers) is downloaded 4,200,000 times a week via npm.


## Why we're looking for support

TurfJS is a community-driven project maintained by a small group of core contributors who work on the project in their spare time.
Time is spent investigating issues, supporting users, improving documentation, fixing bugs, and adding new functionality.
Your funding will go directly to development costs, marketing campaigns, promotional events, and other expenses needed to maintain and promote TurfJS.

In particular, we're looking for corporate sponsors who use TurfJS in revenue-generating ways, either by creating applications for clients, or through use in an app used by customers.
Of course individuals are welcome to support us as well if TurfJS has helped you :)
