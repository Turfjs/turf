/**
 * Takes a {@link FeatureCollection} of points and calculates the median center,
 * algorithimically. The median center is understood as the point that is
 * requires the least total travel from all other points.
 *
 * Turfjs has four different functions for calculating the center of a set of
 * data. Each is useful depending on circumstance.
 *
 * `@turf/center` finds the simple center of a dataset, by finding the
 * midpoint between the extents of the data. That is, it divides in half the
 * farthest east and farthest west point as well as the farthest north and
 * farthest south.
 *
 * `@turf/center-of-mass` imagines that the dataset is a sheet of paper.
 * The center of mass is where the sheet would balance on a fingertip.
 *
 * `@turf/center-mean` takes the averages of all the coordinates and
 * produces a value that respects that. Unlike `@turf/center`, it is
 * sensitive to clusters and outliers. It lands in the statistical middle of a
 * dataset, not the geographical. It can also be weighted, meaning certain
 * points are more important than others.
 *
 * `@turf/center-median` takes the mean center and tries to find, iteratively,
 * a new point that requires the least amount of travel from all the points in
 * the dataset. It is not as sensitive to outliers as `@turf/center-mean`, but it is
 * attracted to clustered data. It, too, can be weighted.
