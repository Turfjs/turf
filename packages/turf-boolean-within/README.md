# @turf/boolean-within

<!-- Generated by documentation.js. Update this documentation by updating the source code. -->

## booleanWithin

Boolean-within returns true if the first geometry is completely within the second geometry.
The interiors of both geometries must intersect and, the interior and boundary of the primary (geometry a)
must not intersect the exterior of the secondary (geometry b).
Boolean-within returns the exact opposite result of the `@turf/boolean-contains`.

### Parameters

*   `feature1` **([Geometry][1] | [Feature][2]\<any>)** GeoJSON Feature or Geometry
*   `feature2` **([Geometry][1] | [Feature][2]\<any>)** GeoJSON Feature or Geometry

### Examples

```javascript
var line = turf.lineString([[1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]]);
var point = turf.point([1, 2]);

turf.booleanWithin(point, line);
//=true
```

Returns **[boolean][3]** true/false
