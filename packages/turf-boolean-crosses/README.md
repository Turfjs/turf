## booleanCrosses

Boolean-Crosses returns True if the intersection results in a geometry whose dimension is one less than
the maximum dimension of the two source geometries and the intersection set is interior to
both source geometries.

Boolean-Crosses returns t (TRUE) for only multipoint/polygon, multipoint/linestring, linestring/linestring, linestring/polygon, and linestring/multipolygon comparisons.
Other comparisons are not supported as they are outside the OpenGIS Simple Features spec and may give unexpected results.

### Parameters

*   `feature1` **([Geometry][1] | [Feature][2]\<any>)** GeoJSON Feature or Geometry
*   `feature2` **([Geometry][1] | [Feature][2]\<any>)** GeoJSON Feature or Geometry

### Examples

```javascript
var line1 = turf.lineString([[-2, 2], [4, 2]]);
var line2 = turf.lineString([[1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]]);

var cross = turf.booleanCrosses(line1, line2);
//=true
```

Returns **[boolean][3]** true/false
