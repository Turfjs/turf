# @turf/idw

Takes a FeatureCollection of points with known value, a power parameter, a cell depth, a unit of measurement
and returns a FeatureCollection of polygons in a square-grid with an interpolated value property "IDW" for each grid cell.
It finds application when in need of creating a continuous surface (i.e. rainfall, temperature, chemical dispersion surface...)
from a set of spatially scattered points.

**Parameters**

-   `controlPoints` **[FeatureCollection](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#feature-collection-objects)&lt;[Point](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#point)>** Sampled points with known value
-   `valueField` **[String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** GeoJSON field containing the known value to interpolate on
-   `b` **[Number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** Exponent regulating the distance-decay weighting
-   `cellWidth` **[Number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** The distance across each cell
-   `units` **[String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** Units to use for cellWidth ('miles' or 'kilometers')

Returns **[FeatureCollection](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#feature-collection-objects)&lt;[Polygon](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#polygon)>** grid A grid of polygons with a property field "IDW"
