## midpoint

Takes two [points](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.2) and returns a point midway between them.
The midpoint is calculated geodesically, meaning the curvature of the earth is taken into account.

**Parameters**

-   `point1` **[Coord](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.1)** first point
-   `point2` **[Coord](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.1)** second point

**Examples**

```javascript
var point1 = turf.point([144.834823, -37.771257]);
var point2 = turf.point([145.14244, -37.830937]);

var midpoint = turf.midpoint(point1, point2);

//addToMap
var addToMap = [point1, point2, midpoint];
midpoint.properties['marker-color'] = '#f00';
```

Returns **[Feature](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.2)&lt;[Point](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.2)>** a point midway between `pt1` and `pt2`
