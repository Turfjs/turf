<!-- Generated by documentation.js. Update this documentation by updating the source code. -->

## midpoint

Takes two [points][1] and returns a point midway between them.
The midpoint is calculated geodesically, meaning the curvature of the earth is taken into account.

### Parameters

*   `point1` **[Coord][2]** first point
*   `point2` **[Coord][2]** second point

### Examples

```javascript
var point1 = turf.point([144.834823, -37.771257]);
var point2 = turf.point([145.14244, -37.830937]);

var midpoint = turf.midpoint(point1, point2);

//addToMap
var addToMap = [point1, point2, midpoint];
midpoint.properties['marker-color'] = '#f00';
```

Returns **[Feature][3]<[Point][4]>** a point midway between `pt1` and `pt2`
