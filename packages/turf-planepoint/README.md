## planepoint

Takes a triangular plane as a [Polygon][1]
and a [Point][2] within that triangle and returns the z-value
at that point. The Polygon should have properties `a`, `b`, and `c`
that define the values at its three corners. Alternatively, the z-values
of each triangle point can be provided by their respective 3rd coordinate
if their values are not provided as properties.

### Parameters

*   `point` **[Coord][3]** the Point for which a z-value will be calculated
*   `triangle` **[Feature][4]<[Polygon][5]>** a Polygon feature with three vertices

### Examples

```javascript
var point = turf.point([-75.3221, 39.529]);
// "a", "b", and "c" values represent the values of the coordinates in order.
var triangle = turf.polygon([[
  [-75.1221, 39.57],
  [-75.58, 39.18],
  [-75.97, 39.86],
  [-75.1221, 39.57]
]], {
  "a": 11,
  "b": 122,
  "c": 44
});

var zValue = turf.planepoint(point, triangle);
point.properties.zValue = zValue;

//addToMap
var addToMap = [triangle, point];
```

Returns **[number][6]** the z-value for `interpolatedPoint`
