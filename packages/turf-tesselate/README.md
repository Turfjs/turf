# turf-tesselate

# tesselate

Tesselates a [Feature&lt;Polygon>](Feature<Polygon>) into a [FeatureCollection&lt;Polygon>](FeatureCollection<Polygon>) of triangles
using [earcut](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut).

**Parameters**

-   `polygon` **Feature&lt;Polygon>** the polygon to tesselate

**Examples**

```javascript
var polygon = {"type":"Feature","id":"USA-CA","properties":{"name":"California"},"geometry":{"type":"Polygon","coordinates":[[[-123.233256,42.006186],[-122.378853,42.011663],[-121.037003,41.995232],[-120.001861,41.995232],[-119.996384,40.264519],[-120.001861,38.999346],[-118.71478,38.101128],[-117.498899,37.21934],[-116.540435,36.501861],[-115.85034,35.970598],[-114.634459,35.00118],[-114.634459,34.87521],[-114.470151,34.710902],[-114.333228,34.448009],[-114.136058,34.305608],[-114.256551,34.174162],[-114.415382,34.108438],[-114.535874,33.933176],[-114.497536,33.697668],[-114.524921,33.54979],[-114.727567,33.40739],[-114.661844,33.034958],[-114.524921,33.029481],[-114.470151,32.843265],[-114.524921,32.755634],[-114.72209,32.717295],[-116.04751,32.624187],[-117.126467,32.536556],[-117.24696,32.668003],[-117.252437,32.876127],[-117.329114,33.122589],[-117.471515,33.297851],[-117.7837,33.538836],[-118.183517,33.763391],[-118.260194,33.703145],[-118.413548,33.741483],[-118.391641,33.840068],[-118.566903,34.042715],[-118.802411,33.998899],[-119.218659,34.146777],[-119.278905,34.26727],[-119.558229,34.415147],[-119.875891,34.40967],[-120.138784,34.475393],[-120.472878,34.448009],[-120.64814,34.579455],[-120.609801,34.858779],[-120.670048,34.902595],[-120.631709,35.099764],[-120.894602,35.247642],[-120.905556,35.450289],[-121.004141,35.461243],[-121.168449,35.636505],[-121.283465,35.674843],[-121.332757,35.784382],[-121.716143,36.195153],[-121.896882,36.315645],[-121.935221,36.638785],[-121.858544,36.6114],[-121.787344,36.803093],[-121.929744,36.978355],[-122.105006,36.956447],[-122.335038,37.115279],[-122.417192,37.241248],[-122.400761,37.361741],[-122.515777,37.520572],[-122.515777,37.783465],[-122.329561,37.783465],[-122.406238,38.15042],[-122.488392,38.112082],[-122.504823,37.931343],[-122.701993,37.893004],[-122.937501,38.029928],[-122.97584,38.265436],[-123.129194,38.451652],[-123.331841,38.566668],[-123.44138,38.698114],[-123.737134,38.95553],[-123.687842,39.032208],[-123.824765,39.366301],[-123.764519,39.552517],[-123.85215,39.831841],[-124.109566,40.105688],[-124.361506,40.259042],[-124.410798,40.439781],[-124.158859,40.877937],[-124.109566,41.025814],[-124.158859,41.14083],[-124.065751,41.442061],[-124.147905,41.715908],[-124.257444,41.781632],[-124.213628,42.000709],[-123.233256,42.006186]]]}};
