[Turf](http://turfjs.org/) tesselate module


### `turf.tesselate(polygon)`

Tesselates a Feature into a FeatureCollection of triangles 
using [earcut](https://github.com/mapbox/earcut).


### Parameters

| parameter | type                 | description              |
| --------- | -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `polygon` | Feature\.\<Polygon\> | the polygon to tesselate |


### Example

```js
