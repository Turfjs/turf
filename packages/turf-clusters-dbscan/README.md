# @turf/clusters-distance

# clustersDbscan

Takes a set of [points](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#point) and partition them into clusters according to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN](DBSCAN's) data clustering algorithm.

**Parameters**

-   `points` **[FeatureCollection](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#feature-collection-objects)&lt;[Point](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#point)>** to be clustered
-   `maxDistance` **[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** Maximum Distance between any point of the cluster to generate the clusters (kilometers only)
-   `units` **\[[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)]** in which `maxDistance` is expressed, can be degrees, radians, miles, or kilometers (optional, default `kilometers`)
-   `minPoints` **\[[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)]** Minimum number of points to generate a single cluster, points will be excluded if the
        cluster does not meet the minimum amounts of points. (optional, default `3`)

**Examples**

```javascript
// create random points with random z-values in their properties
var points = turf.random('point', 100, {
  bbox: [0, 30, 20, 50]
});
var distance = 100;
var clustered = turf.clustersDistance(points, distance);

//addToMap
var addToMap = featureCollection(clustered.points);
```

Returns **[FeatureCollection](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#feature-collection-objects)&lt;[Point](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#point)>** each Point has two extra properties; `cluster` property with the cluster number it belongs &
`dbscan` which is defines the which type of point it has been flagged as ('core'|'edge'|'noise').
