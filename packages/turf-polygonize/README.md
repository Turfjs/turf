## polygonize

Polygonizes [(Multi)LineString(s)][1] into [Polygons][2].

Implementation of GEOSPolygonize function (`geos::operation::polygonize::Polygonizer`).

Polygonizes a set of lines that represents edges in a planar graph. Edges must be correctly
noded, i.e., they must only meet at their endpoints.

The implementation correctly handles:

*   Dangles: edges which have one or both ends which are not incident on another edge endpoint.
*   Cut Edges (bridges): edges that are connected at both ends but which do not form part of a polygon.

### Parameters

*   `geoJson` **([FeatureCollection][3] | [Geometry][4] | [Feature][5]<([LineString][6] | [MultiLineString][7])>)** Lines in order to polygonize

<!---->

*   Throws **[Error][8]** if geoJson is invalid.

Returns **[FeatureCollection][3]<[Polygon][9]>** Polygons created
