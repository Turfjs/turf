# @turf/polygonize

# index

Implementation of GEOSPolygonize function (`geos::operation::polygonize::Polygonizer`).

Polygonizes a set of lines that represents edges in a planar graph. Edges must be correctly
noded, i.e., they must only meet at their endpoints. LineStrings must only have two coordinate
points.

The implementation correctly handles:

-   Dangles: edges which have one or both ends which are not incident on another edge endpoint.
-   Cut Edges (bridges): edges that are connected at both ends but which do not form part
      of a polygon.

**Parameters**

-   `geoJson` **[FeatureCollection](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#feature-collection-objects)&lt;[LineString](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#linestring)>** Lines in order to polygonize

Returns **[FeatureCollection](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#feature-collection-objects)&lt;[Polygon](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#polygon)>** Polygons created
